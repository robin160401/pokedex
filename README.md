## API

### Which API did we use?

We used <b><u>[pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/)</u></b>.
The API is free to use and does not require an API key. It is very complex, which is why we have limited ourselves to the 1st generation.

### Fetch

We have written various functions to fetch the data from the API, integrate filter and search functions and retrieve images.

<br>

## Design

There was a design template that we used as a guide, but we also added a few extras.

<br>

## Deployment

We realized the deployment with Netlify

<br>

## Todos

Mediaqueries are still missing - but will be added later, until then the page is optimized for Desktop.
